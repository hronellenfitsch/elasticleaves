Code to generate the data for H. Ronellenfitsch. “Optimal Elasticity of Biological Networks”. Physical Review Letters 126 (3 Jan. 2021), 038101. doi: 10.1103/PhysRevLett.126.038101.

The code is written in Julia 1.5. Results are generated by typing
  `julia run_parallel.jl`
and are analyzed using the PaperFigures.ipynb notebook. The results used in the paper are too large to put on github and are available here: https://www.dropbox.com/s/ebht8do13lhhhuc/results.zip?dl=0 (168 MB)
